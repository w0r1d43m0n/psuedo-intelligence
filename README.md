# Psuedo-Intelligence
Psuedo-Intelligence is an AI powered digital assistant. It is written in pure Python, is 100% open source, and is completely free.  
The official website is https://www.oreodog.us/psuedo-intelligence.html.  

The Releases section comes with installers for `psuedo.exe`, but if you would prefer to build it yourself, follow the build instructions.

## Build Instructions
### Windows
Download Python.  
Install pyinstaller using the python package manager (pip).  
Run the build command from `BuildCommand.txt`.  
Run the executable in the dist folder (`psuedo.exe`).  

Pull requests are welcome! Although I doubt anyone except me will ever read this.
